<p>Hi <%= @first_name %>,<p>

<p>
  Thank you for choosing MortgageClub. Weâ€™re working hard to help close your loan on time!
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, due to the delay in [INSERT REASONS HERE], we have to move the closing date to <%= @closing_date.strftime("%m/%d/%Y") %>.
</p>

<p>If you have any issues or questions, please contact me at <a href="mailto:<%= @current_user.email %>"><%= @current_user.email %></a> or <%= ActionController::Base.helpers.number_to_phone @current_user.loan_member.phone_number %>.</p>
