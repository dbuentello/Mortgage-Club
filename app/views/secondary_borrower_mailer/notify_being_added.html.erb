<p>Hi <b><%= @secondary_borrower.user.to_s %></b>,</p>

<br/>
<p>You've just been added as secondary borrower by <b><%= @loan.user.to_s %></b>.</p>

<% if @is_new_user %>
  <p><%= link_to 'Login', new_user_session_url %> to see your loan now, new user. Your default password: <%= @default_password %></p>
  <b><p>Please change your password after your first login for security reason.</p></b>
<% else %>
  <p>Because you've already had your own loan, we cannot show the loan you've been added as co-borrower for now. We will add this feature soon.</p>
<% end %>

<br/>
Thanks and Best Regards,
